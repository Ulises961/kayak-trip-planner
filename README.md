# Kayak trip planner
This application serves as a trip planner and information point for all the members of a shared kayak trip.

A user creates a trip and invites all the members that will partake on the adventure. Each invited member can then access to the information relative to the trip. More specifically, the itinerary marked on a map, the inventory of needed items, the weather and sea state for the duration of the trip, plus the stops and possible interest points along the way.

Pictures can be loaded on the points of the trip, and then all the information can be saved and, if wanted, shared publicly to every user of the platform so that to share knowledge and the experience.
